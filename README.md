# Couch Bum

What if you could get travel accomadation for free and share your passions at the same time? What if you could make new friends and see new places without having to put anything on a debit card? Couch Bum is a platform that lets you exchange your skills and experience for lodging. Once you sign-up, you are already a traveler. Once you post your first listing, you become a host.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Node & npm
```

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
cd ~/Projects # go to your project folder
```
```
git clone https://github.com/mrwhiterk/couch_bum
